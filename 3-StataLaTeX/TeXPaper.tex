\section{Wait for it}

This is where I introduce you to my amazingness.
I'm going to do a little thing where I include numerical output from Stata.

The mean of the price variable is $\meanprice$ and its standard deviation (rounded to one decimal point) is $\stddevprice$

\subsection{Wait for it.}

More text, and ... a table! 

\begin{table}
\caption{Made Automatically in Stata}
\input{outputS.tex} %created by StataLaTeX.do
\end{table}
%input the table you generated in Stata with outreg2 or estout
%This is a relatively simple 2-click workflow
%One click in Stata to run all your code and generate the results
%and a second click to compile and include those results into your paper.

%The concern is that with a lot of tables, you can forget which script file generated
%which table. Hence the comment above next to the input statement.



\end{document}
