****************************************
* To refer to specific values, you can send the output to a file, 
* and then call that output in LaTeX
* Thanks to Henrique Romero for this.
****************************************

*(1)* Write a little Stata program to define a new LaTeX command
cap program drop latexnc
program define latexnc
*Spot is the string with the name
local spot1="`1'"
*Spot2 is the actual value stored in the scalar
local spot2=`1'
local latexnc1 "\newcommand{\\`spot1'}{`spot2'}"
! echo `latexnc1' >> `2' 
end 

*(2)* Use the program to send output to a file
* NB: You could also do this in one step since you can write directly to a file.
sysuse auto, clear
*Create empty tex file to store new commands
! echo > .\StataScalarList.tex
* We want to mention the mean price in our paper 
sum price 
*Need to use full path to tex file because the stata working directory doesn't pass through the shell command 
scalar meanprice=r(mean)
latexnc meanprice ".\StataScalarList.tex"

*We can also round numbers if we wish 
scalar stddevprice=round(`r(sd)',.1) 
latexnc stddevprice ".\StataScalarList.tex"
