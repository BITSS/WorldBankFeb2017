### Materials for the February 2017 Reproducibility Training at the World Bank

The numbered files/directories will take you through the workshop in order.

First, 1-Intro features a set of slides (Beamer/LaTeX slides rendered as PDF) that discuss the reproducibility crisis in the social sciences.

Second, 2-GitDemo.md is an introduction to version control with Git.

## Installation Instructions (See bottom for Bank machine instructions)
The workshop will introduce you to a tool that can help you make your workflow more reproducible: version control (Git/GitHub). You are **strongly** encouraged to install the following software programs either on your personal machine or Bank machine before coming to the workshop for the hands-on exercises. 

### 1. Version Control with Git and the Github Desktop app

Version control is a powerful way to carefully track revisions to your documents as well as to manage collaboration. Git and Github Desktop are packaged together [here](https://desktop.github.com/). Git is the command line tool, and Github Desktop is a GUI version of the same tool. There are actually [a whole bunch of GUI apps](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) that can act as front ends, so you might find later that you prefer another, but we'll stick with Github Desktop for the demo.

##### Optional: Specifics for Specifics Platforms

Note that Github Desktop works on Mac and Windows. If you're a Linux user, you might try one of [these](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux). Also if you're a Windows user, the command line tool that comes with Github Desktop might not be the greatest, so you might want to download [this alternative](https://git-scm.com/download/win). If you've never used the command line before or any of this is confusing, don't worry about it and I'll try to clear it up at the workshop.  

### 2. A good text editor

Writing good code is facilitated by a good text editor. You can get away without one because you almost certainly already have a program on your computer that can save simple ASCII text files (Notepad for Windows, or TextEdit for Mac--but change the default from Rich Text to Plain Text) but modern text editors do syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and a bunch of other cool stuff for you. I suggest [Atom](http://atom.io).

=======
## Bank machine environment setup
**_Currently, only Git app supported for the WBG machines is GitHub Desktop._** You are welcome to install whatever the Git GUI apps you'd like on your personal machine. You can follow the instruction above to install the app.

We encourage all the participants to sign up for the World Bank GitHub pilot program as this will provide a support group within the Bank and opportunities to officially publish your reproducible code from your work. The general steps are below:

1. Once you are registered for the workshop, we will send you a MOU template to join the World Bank GitHub account.
2. If you do not have a GitHub account, please create one. You can create your account for free.
3. Sign MOU with your name and your GitHub username, and send it to github@worldbank.org from your worldbank.org email address. (No need to physically print out and sign.)
4. You will receive an invitation to join the World Bank organizational account as a member.
